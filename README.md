Vanilla JavaScript Application
Functionality (Search and Show Recipes)

Built using Javascript ES6 and JS2015, HMTL5 and CSS

- In this application I used Webpack configuration which allow us to build our code in structure mode and the webpack convert the project files to production files.
- As source folder I used scr folder
- As production folder I uses dist folder
- I am also using Babel to convert de ES6 code (or more recently) to ES5
- To check details see the files: package.json, webpack.config.js and .babelrc
